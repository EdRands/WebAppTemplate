## Installation

Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

The following commands are available from the project folder.

### Live Development Server

yarn serve
```

Then go to http://localhost:1234/ to interact with the app.

This starts the development server, which will automatically rebuild your app as you change files and supports hot module replacement for fast development.
